 
Objective

In this programming assignment we will familiarize ourselves with the programming environment, JavaScript programming language, our IDE, and a little depth with the API that is provided. Though relatively simple, dealing with the strangeness of JavaScript, the many different source code files, and the many new technologies can be confusing and intimidating at times. Please do start early and bring questions to class!

The number of lines of code you need to write is actually relatively small (probably around 100-lines of code). However, instead of developing your own solution, you have to modify and insert your changes into an existing system. This provides you with a flavor for the kinds of work we do in this class. Very quickly programming assignments will demand you to modify a non-trivial game engine consisting of 10â€™s of files and hundreds and thousands of lines of code.

In this assignment, in addition to solving the specify challenge, make sure you have an absolutely and thorough understanding of every single file in your solution. Remember, complexity will increase very rapidly.
