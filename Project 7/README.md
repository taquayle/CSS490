Objective

This programming assignment summarizes the work we have been doing for MP5 and MP6, where we can now formulate and implement responses to collisions based on the Collision Information we have been computing.

Assignment Specification:

The key of this assignment is to build and test collision resolution techniques discussed in class. You will implement a test environment such that you can be reasonably sure that your system is functioning as expected
